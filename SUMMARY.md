## Known Data Gaps

### Missing Seasons

| Season | Reason |
|--------|--------|
| 1911-1912 | No data found in any source |
| 1915-1919 | WWI - competitive football suspended |
| 1921-1922 | No data found in any source (statto.com 404, Transfermarkt empty) |
| 1939-1945 | WWII - competitive football suspended |

### Incomplete Seasons

| Season | Issue |
|--------|-------|
| 1909-1920 | Only FA Cup matches recorded (Southern League data not available) |
| 1922-1925 | FA Cup matches likely missing |
| 1975-1976 | Only 7 matches recorded - significant data gap |
| 2015-2017 | Some cup matches missing |
| 2017-2026 | Competition breakdown not available from football-data.co.uk |

### Data Quality Notes

1. **Pre-1920 Era**: Southend United played in the Southern League from 1906-1920. Only FA Cup matches are recorded in available sources. Southern League match data would require alternative historical sources.

2. **1975-1976 Season**: The data source (statto.com) has a parsing issue for this season. Historical records show Southend played a full Fourth Division season this year.

3. **2017-2026 Seasons**: The football-data.co.uk CSV files don't include competition names, so all matches are categorized as "Unknown". These are primarily league matches.

4. **Playoff Matches**: Some seasons show 48 league matches instead of 46 - these include playoff matches.
